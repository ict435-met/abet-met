				directly relate to Criterion 3.
				an appropriate mastery of the knowledge, techniques, skills and modern tools
				of their disciplines; including:
				2) The use of application software, the design and use of operating systems,
				the analysis, design, testing, and documentation of computer programs in
				support of electronic, instrumentation, communications, control, and/or
				computer systems. Also ABET 2.b, 2.c, 2.d, 2.f
				Course topics and lecture hours devoted to each topic:
				TOPICS  HRS.
				 Essential Computer Concepts 1
				 Exploring the Basics of Microsoft Windows 7 1
				 Managing Your Files 1

				Laboratory Projects: Each laboratory class is 50 minutes. Laboratory exercises are done
				in conjunction with the text readings and the lecture materials. The laboratories are
				designed to learn Office 2010. Equipment utilized by the students include: computers
				with Microsoft Office 2010, Internet Explorer, and Windows 7 installed.
				Example of topics for laboratories include:
				1. Lab 1: Word Project: Rails to Trails;
				2. Lab 2 Excel Project: Displaying your investment portfolio in a chart;
				3. Lab 3: Access Project: Your College Record;
